Lots of news and things to mention today:
<br />
<br />
It's almost time for the SECon 2008-2009 season to begin!  Last year's members, do not forget about our meeting on the 18th at 7pm so we can get things rolling.  New members, please attend the New Member Meetings so you can also hop right into the planning and whatnot.  I decided that the site needs a new look this year, so I will be working on that for the time being and will hopefully have it up soon.
<br />
<br />
Team calendars are up and running "smoothly".  There is still room for some improvement and I am working to resolve issues as they pop up.  Please remember to check the calendars often so we can all be up-to-date on the teams' events.  The TourBot team's calendar may update slightly slower as I have to rely on others to give me the information, I apologize for this in advance.  If it becomes an issue, I will work out another method.
<br />
<br />
Also, for those who are not already IEEE members and wish to be on the SECon team, please check out Auburn University's IEEE page <a href="http://eng.auburn.edu/ieee">Here</a>.  Sign up and become a member so everything can run smoothly around competition time, and IEEE is just plain awesome by itself.
