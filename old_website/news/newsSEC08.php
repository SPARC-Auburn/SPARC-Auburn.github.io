The robot is coming along nicely as the various projects come together to form a final 
product.  Everyone is working extremely hard as we begin our heavy debugging and testing 
phase.  If anyone has a good background in Java and would be willing to help in the 
testing, please stop by the lab or send an <a href="mailto:milleen@auburn.edu">email</a> 
and let us know.  <br /> <br />
The website is coming along nicely too.  I added a new border around the page and an E-Day 
picture page.  If Google&reg; is nice to us, we will be searchable through Google so it 
will be easier to find the site. <br />

With E-Day over, the excitment as slowly settled and now the "real" work sets in.  
With only one month left until the competition in Huntsville, excitement is replaced 
by urgency - no panicky feelings yet.  Currently, the website is still under going 
some upgrades and a Frequently Asked Questions paged is in the works as well.<br />

Yesterday was E-Day 2008 at Auburn University and the many schools had their displays up and ready 
for our visitors.  Questions were asked, demonstrations were carried out, and brouchers ran 
amuck about Foy Student Union.  Our SPaRC display/demo had many visitors asking question of "How 
does it do that?" and "How can I get involved?"  We answered all the questions we could and I feel that 
E-Day for the robotics team was a success.<br />

Most of the team has been preparing for E-Day at Auburn University for the past week or so.
A few of us crawl into the early morning hours the day of the demo for some last minute adjustments
and testing.  While others struggle with bugs and glitches in our many test programs, I've 
been cranking away on the sites layout, so be prepared for changes.<br />
