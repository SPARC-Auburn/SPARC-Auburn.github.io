School has been out for a week now and hopefully everyone is enjoying their beginning-of-summer activities.  For those that will be here in AU over the summer, the SECon team will be performing the usual administrative activities and preparations for the coming year's competition.  Please check back here for times and locations of the meetings.
<br />
<br />
For those in SECon that will not be here this summer, or those who are looking to join the SECon Robotics team, please contact the Project Manager William Woodall or the Webmaster Eric Miler.  The contact information can be found on our members page.

Also, the first public draft of the rules for SECon 2010 have been posted 
<a href="http://sparc.eng.auburn.edu/SECON/2010rules.php">here</a>.  
Please start reviewing the rules now and brainstorm on some ideas so we can get moving quickly in the fall.
