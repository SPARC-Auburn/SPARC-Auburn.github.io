			During Engineering Day 2008 at Auburn University, our SPaRC team had
			our demonstration set up and ready to go.  We demonstrated our robot and its 
			collision detection system using it's sonar ability.  We had a lot of great 
			questions asked and many people seemed very excited to watch the robot drive
			itself around.  
			<br />
			<br />
			Here are a few pictures taken during the demo:
