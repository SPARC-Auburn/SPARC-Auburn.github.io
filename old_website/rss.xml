	Please remember to post on the wiki about the pros/cons of the concepts we have been discussing as we need to progress forward in design.  There are also no more New Member meetings, so any questions you or anyone you know may have, please come to the meeting on Tuesdays at 6pm in Broun 235 and ask us.
