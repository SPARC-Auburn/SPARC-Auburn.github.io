			While having our demonstrations as well as from our many fliers around campus, we on 
			the SPaRC team get asked many questions about all kinds of things.  Because of this, we 
			decided to compile a list of the frequently asked questions:
			</blockquote>
			<br />
			<blockquote>
			<img src="images/Q-graphic.gif" alt="Q: " /> What does SPaRC stand for and what do you do?
			<br />
			<img src="images/A-graphic.gif" alt="A: " /> SPaRC stands for the Student Projects and Research Committee.  We are a group 
			of students (and professors) that work together on various projects.  Currently we 
			have two teams: the Competitive Robotics Team ad TourBot.  We hope in the future as more 
			students become interested in SPaRC to have more projects up and going.

			<blockquote>
			<img src="images/Q-graphic.gif" alt="Q: " /> What is the Competitive Robotics Team?
			<br />
			<img src="images/A-graphic.gif" alt="A: " /> SPaRC's Competitive Robotics Team is a group of students who build a fully functioning 
			autonomous robot to compete at IEEE SoutheastCon competition.  Near the beginning of a Fall semester, the team is given the challenges 
			that they will need to overcome at the upcoming SEC, usually held in April of that school year.  Find out more information at the 
			Competitive Robotics Team page <a href="SECONTeam.php">here</a>.

			<blockquote>
			<img src="images/Q-graphic.gif" alt="Q: " /> What is TourBot?
			<br />
			<img src="images/A-graphic.gif" alt="A: " /> SPaRC's TourBot team is a wide array of students working together to create an autonomous 
			robot tour guide.  This robot will lead visitors through Auburn's many buildings and around the beautiful campus.  The TourBot project is not 
			for any competition, merely built to show people what our students here at Auburn University can do when we work together as teams.  
			Find out more information at the TourBot Team page <a href="tourbotTeam.php">here</a>.
