            <br />
            
			<font size="+1"><b>I. Introduction</b></font><br />
			Renewable energy is critical to the well being of our planet and civilization. In the spirit of<br />
			renewable energy, Southeast Conference 2010 will focus on the use of green energy in<br />
			autonomous vehicles. In this competition no batteries or fuel will be used as a source of energy.<br />
			A combination of solar power and capacitors is one anticipated solution.<br />
			<br />
            
			<font size="+1"><b>II. Objective</b></font><br />
			The primary objective of this competition will be to drive around a track as many times as<br />
			possible within the given time limit. The track will contain several different types of obstacles<br />
			and terrains. In order to successfully complete the challenge, a vehicle needs to travel around the<br />
			track, passing through/over obstacles. Points will be awarded for every lap successfully<br />
			completed, however, bonus points will also be awarded to vehicles that successfully navigate one<br />
			or all of the obstacles on a given lap.<br />
			<br />
			It is the hope that student teams will learn and apply several key Electrical and Computer<br />
			Engineering technologies in their vehicle, including:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Solar panel analysis and power harvesting</li>
				<li>Very-low power computing</li>
				<li>Efficient electrical to mechanical conversion and propulsion</li>
				<li>Problem solving, algorithm development, and course strategy</li>
			</ul>
            
			<font size="+1"><b>III. Playing Field</b></font><br />
			The playing field will consist of a 10x10 foot square of AstroTurf that is ringed by wooden 2x4s.<br />
			There will be a 4x4 foot wooden 2x4 square in the center of the track to create the inside wall of<br />
			the track. On three of the outside walls, obstacles will be placed (see Figure 1):<br />
            <ul>
				<li>Height Obstacle: Consists of a 2x4 structure with the inside dimensions of 16 "wide by
					8" tall.</li>
				<li>Width Obstacle: Consists of a 2x4 structure with the inside dimensions of 8" wide by
					16" tall.</li>
				<li>Ramp Obstacle: Consists of a 16" wide Plexiglas ramp with 3faces, each 12" long, with
					the front and back faces at an angle of 30 degrees between the floor and the top surface.</li>
            </ul>
			The starting line will also host a "basking light" which will be an intense light that can charge<br />
            <br />
            
			<font size="+1"><b>IV. Vehicle</b></font><br />
			There are no regulations on the size of the vehicle, other than it must be shorter that 16" tall and<br />
			must operate solely in the active playing field. Only commercially-available solar and passive<br />
			storage devices (i.e. capacitors) can be used; no batteries of any sort may be used during the race<br />
			trials and competition (you can use batteries during development and testing). The vehicle may<br />
			not use any other fuel or any mechanical storage device.<br />
            <br />
            
			<font size="+1"><b>V. Rules of Play</b></font><br />
			At the start of each vehicle's trial run, the vehicle's energy storage device must be completely<br />
			discharged.<br />
            <br />
			A competitor will place their vehicle in the basking circle - at the time they place the robot, their<br />
			three minute trial begins. The vehicle must drive around the track as many times as possible,<br />
			attempting to acquire as many points along the way as possible. It must travel in the counter-<br />
			clockwise direction.<br />
            <br />
            
			<font size="+1"><b>VI. Competition Format</b></font><br />
			The competition will include three phases:<br />
            <blockquote>
				1. Qualifying round: A vehicle must earn at least one point to qualify for<br /> the main
				competition round of the contest.<br />
				2. Competition round: A vehicle will be given three trials. All vehicles will be ranked by
				their highest score attained. The top three vehicles (that scored more than zero points
				during all three trials) will advance to the final round.<br />
				3. Final Round: At the Saturday Banquet the three top vehicles will compete head-to-head
				and determine the first, second, and third place ranking.<br />
            </blockquote>
            
			<font size="+1"><b>VII. Scoring</b></font><br />
			Points can be accumulated based on the number of laps made by the vehicle and obstacles<br />
			successfully passed in one direction. Note that points will be deducted if the vehicle passes the<br />
			obstacle in one direction, then in the other direction. Scoring will be counted when the front of<br />
			the vehicle passes the back-side of the obstacle. A vehicle must pass the starting line (basking<br />
			lamp) before it can earn points for the same obstacle again.<br />
            	<blockquote>
				1 point - move completely off the 18" basking light circle<br />
				5 points - each lap completed<br />
				25 points - each height obstacle completed<br />
				25 points - each length obstacle completed<br />
				50 points - each ramp obstacle completed<br />
                </blockquote>
                
			<font size="+1"><b>VIII. Changes</b></font><br />
			These rules may be changed before September 15, 2009. The rules will be frozen on September<br />
			15, 2009, and will only be changed by the approval of the Region 3 Student Activities Chair.<br />
