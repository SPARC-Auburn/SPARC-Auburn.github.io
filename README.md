<h3>Overview</h3>
We use Github as a host for the SPaRC website.  This allows us to have free storage and a free domain. It also allow us to easily collaborate in editing the website.  It is composed entirely of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.  The website is based off of the flat graphic style and is set up as a single page for ease of navigation and simplicity.  The main content is contained in index.html.  The main styling is contained in css/style.css.  If you would like to have access to edit the website and are a part of the SPARC-Auburn Github email mattcastle38@gmail.com to be added to the SPARC Website team.<br/>
